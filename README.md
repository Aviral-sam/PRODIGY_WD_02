This is a stopwatch web application,
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML is used to structure the elements
of the application. By implementing
functions for starting, pausing, and
resetting the stopwatch, as well as
tracking and displaying lap times, users
can accurately measure and record time
intervals. With these technologies and
functionalities,

the web application provides a user-friendly interface
and a reliable performance. CSS is used to style the elements
and create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
JavaScript is used to add interactivity and logic to the application,
such as updating the stopwatch display, storing the lap times in an array,
and clearing the lap times list. The web application also uses some advanced
JavaScript features, such as arrow functions, template literals, and the set Interval method.
